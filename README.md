# ClearView Digital — Static Website

This is a fully static, multi-page website starter in deep green tones to mirror your sister company's tone.

## Structure
- `index.html` (Home)
- `who.html` (Who We Are)
- `services.html` (What We Do)
- `work.html` (Case Studies)
- `insights.html` (Insights)
- `partners.html` (Partners — optional)
- `careers.html` (Join Our Team)
- `contact.html` (Get In Touch)
- `assets/css/styles.css` (Global styles; heavily annotated)
- `assets/js/main.js` (Mobile nav + contact form; annotated)

## Editing Notes
- Update the land acknowledgment in the footer to reflect office locations.
- Replace placeholder text, metrics, and images with real content.
- To wire the contact form to a backend, set `CONTACT_ENDPOINT` in `assets/js/main.js`
- TODO: extract `header_html` and `footer_html` into includes.
